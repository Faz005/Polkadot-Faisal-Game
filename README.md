# Polkadot-Faisal-Game
Project Description: Dice Trading Game with Polkadot and Unique Network Integration
Overview:
The Dice Trading Game is a web-based application designed to simulate trading scenarios where users maximize their expected profit over a series of trading rounds. The game leverages the capabilities of the Polkadot network and the Unique Network parachain to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be integrated into interactive applications.

Key Features:

User Interface: The game features a clean and user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS. The interface includes sections for market quotes, trade inputs, and wallet connections.
Dynamic Market Quotes: The game simulates a trading environment by providing dynamic bid and ask prices for users to make buy and sell decisions.
Polkadot Wallet Integration: Users can connect their Polkadot wallet to the game, facilitating a realistic interaction with blockchain technology.
Simulated Transactions: Each trading round simulates a transaction processed using the Unique Network and Polkadot parachain, demonstrating the interoperability and transaction capabilities of the Polkadot ecosystem.
Balance Management: The game maintains and updates the user's balance based on trading activities, providing real-time feedback on trading performance.
Feedback Mechanism: After each round, the game displays a message indicating that the transaction was processed using the Unique Network and Polkadot parachain, enhancing user engagement and understanding of the underlying technology.
Technical Components:

HTML & CSS: Structure and style the web interface.
JavaScript: Implement game logic, manage user interactions, and handle dynamic content updates.
@polkadot/api: Connect to the Polkadot network, enabling interactions with the blockchain and facilitating wallet connectivity.
Simulated Unique Network Integration: Simulate the processing of transactions using the Unique Network parachain to demonstrate interoperability and the unique features of the Polkadot ecosystem.
How It Works:

Wallet Connection: Users enter their Polkadot wallet address and connect to the game. The wallet address is validated, and a connection message is displayed.
Market Quotes Update: The game generates random bid and ask prices for each trading round, simulating a dynamic market environment.
Trading Actions: Users can specify the number of units to buy or sell based on the current market quotes. The game updates the user's balance based on the trade and provides feedback on the transaction.
Next Round: Clicking the "Next Round" button initiates a new trading round, updates market quotes, and displays a message indicating the transaction was processed using the Unique Network and Polkadot parachain.
